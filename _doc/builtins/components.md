### ComponentStatic

URuntimeMeshComponentStatic is a wrapper component that combines URuntimeMeshComponent and URuntimeMeshProviderStatic such that you can use this component in a similar way to the ProceduralMeshComponent or RMC v3 or lower. Using this component is simple, instead of using URuntimeMeshComponent, simply use URuntimeMeshComponentStatic instead.
